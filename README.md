# DS Final
 Data Science Final Project

## Introduction
The objective of this project is to see the effects of dimensionality reduction on training neural networks, specifically to see the effects of dimensionality reduction on a MLPClassifier for recognizing handwritten digits. 

## Data
We used the MNIST Handwritten data set. MNIST comes with 60,000 samples of 28x28 handwritten digits and an additional 10,000 samples as training data.
